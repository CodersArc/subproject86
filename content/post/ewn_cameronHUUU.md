# TÄMÄ MENEE VASEMMALLE!

Eikäkö niinko siis mitäkä?

# Nickname Registration

Your nick is how people on freenode know you. If you register it, you'll be able to use the same nick over and over. If you don't register, someone else may end up registering the nick you want. If you register and use the same nick, people will begin to know you by reputation.

If a channel is set to mode +r, you won't be able to join it unless you are registered and identified to NickServ. If you try to join, you might be forwarded to a different channel. If a channel is set to quiet unregistered users (mode +q $~a), you won't be able to speak while on that channel unless you are registered and identified. Both of these modes are used by some channels to reduce channel harassment and abuse.

# Nickname Expiry

Registered nicknames and accounts will expire if they're not used for a long time, after which they'll be available for another user to take over. See our policies for details of when this occurs.

While nicknames and accounts do not automatically get deleted when they expire -- only when another user requests to take over the registration -- we do occasionally perform clean-up runs on the services database, in which we will automatically drop all registrations which have been idle for a long time. When we do this, we set the threshold for deletion considerably higher than the documented expiry time, to ensure that users close to the limit do not lose out.
